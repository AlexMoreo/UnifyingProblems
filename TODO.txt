- Experiments all: reconsider size? currently is len(test)
- Add classifiers (MLP o deep, LR, kNN, SVM, DecisionTrees) to calibration experiments
- Add covariate shift experiments
- Add calibration plots, and error by shift
- Add quantification diagonal plots, and error by shift
- Add CAP diagonal plots, and error by shift
- Add calibration via kde distribution matching [maybe no]
- Add calibration-extrapolation exactly as defined in their paper; no, seems that we cannot
- Document everything
