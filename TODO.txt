- Experiments all: reconsider size? currently is len(test)
- Add classifiers (MLP o deep, LR, kNN, SVM, DecisionTrees) to calibration experiments
- Add covariate shift experiments
- Add calibration plots, and error by shift
- Add quantification diagonal plots, and error by shift
- Add CAP diagonal plots, and error by shift
- Add calibration via kde distribution matching [maybe no]
- Add calibration-extrapolation exactly as defined in their paper
- Add baselines:
    Calibration: EMQ-based, some iid (e.g., Platt Scalling, Empirical binning?)
    CAP: kFCV o train/val mejor
- Document everything
