- Add to requirements LasCal stuff: clone project, install:
    - rich, cvxpy

Running:
- oficina:
    cap_experiments at 250
    calibration covariate_shift Cpcs
- barracuda
    calibration covariate_shift Lascal
    calibration covariate_shift Transcal [completo]
    calibration covariate_shift Head2Tail [lo he parado, va demasiado lento]

- Experiments all: reconsider size? currently is len(test)
- Add classifiers (MLP o deep, LR, kNN, SVM, DecisionTrees) to calibration experiments
- Add covariate shift experiments
- Add calibration plots, and error by shift
- Add quantification diagonal plots, and error by shift
- Add CAP diagonal plots, and error by shift
- Add calibration via kde distribution matching [maybe no]
- Add calibration-extrapolation exactly as defined in their paper; no, seems that we cannot
- Document everything
